My Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, designed using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and achievements in Computer Science Engineering.
I created this portfolio to give a quick overview of my academic background, technical expertise, and hobbies.
The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
Feel free to browse through the projects section to see what Iâ€™ve been working on.
You can contact me through the information provided in the contact section.
Any feedback or suggestions to improve the portfolio are highly appreciated!
